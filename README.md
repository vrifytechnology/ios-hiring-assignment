# worldle

The goal of this project is to see your code organization and architecture by making a simple "Worldle" clone.

Check out the original at https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/ to see how it plays.

## What's Included
- check out `countries.json` for a list of countries to be used
- Each countries image can be found at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gist/smoroden/4599bfcde936165187d7476cfc148101/raw/366b16d7d82a7d6ed9500cc3cddd6c8a57bb1076/[countryCode].svg`
- A helper function `bearingDegreesTo` on `CLLocation` to get the degrees from one location to another.

## Basic Rules + Requirements
- We encourage SwiftUI as new work on our projects uses it but UIKit is acceptable.
- A user can have up to 6 guesses.
- Previous guesses should be displayed with the distance and direction to the answer.
- If a user guesses correctly or runs out of guesses the countries name should be displayed and no more guesses are allowed.
- In this version we will allow unlimited plays. Add functionality to let the user play again after a round has ended.
- Include auto completion/country suggestions based on user input.

## Optional Requirements
- We don't want anyone spending an excessive amount of time on this. We know our candidates have lives so make sure to read `What We Are Looking For!`
- Unit tests
- Animations
- Instructions, Settings and Statistics sheets/modals

## What We Are Looking For
- Some sort of architecture
- Understanding of making networking requests
- Basic understanging of SwiftUI
- "Production ready" code. Whatever that means to you.
- Use any means/tool/pattern you think is applicable

## After 
- Send the zipped project to your contact
